That escalated quickly\!

I started building vibescaffold.dev last week, and launched on Saturday. 48 hours later... 

I built this to scratch my own itch. I've been deep in AI coding tools - Claude Code and Codex CLI primarily - and kept hitting the same wall. These tools are incredible, but they need structure. Give them a vague idea, you get vague code. They need real specs, clear context, and detailed rules to build anything complex.

So I built a tool that turns rough product ideas into the structured specifications AI coding agents actually need. No sign-up, no friction - you just click and start chatting.

I expected maybe a few dozen people to try it, not 2300\! If this keeps up, I'm going to have to figure out how to make the app pay for itself\! 😅

Here's what I think worked:

\* I know the space

\* One problem, solved well - no feature creep

\* Zero friction - click, chat, get specs

Grateful to everyone who's tried it so far. If you're building with AI coding tools, give it a shot and let me know what you think\!
