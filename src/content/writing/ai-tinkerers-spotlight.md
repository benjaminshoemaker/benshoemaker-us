Excited to share that Vibe Scaffold, my tool for guiding rough ideas into refined technical architectures, was just featured in the AI Tinkerers Community Spotlights!

This project helps bridge the gap between initial concept and executable architecture for AI coding agents.

Thanks to Joe Heitzeberg and the team at AI Tinkerers for the highlight. Read the full feature: [AI Tinkerers Community Spotlights • Issue \#12](https://post-training.aitinkerers.org/p/community-spotlights-issue-12)
