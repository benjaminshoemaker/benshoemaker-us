As most folks on here know now, I've been using AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex CLI) for a while now, and like many developers, I wanted to improve my workflow.

AI coding agents are powerful but unreliable. Most workflow solutions I found were either too complex or too prescriptive for a space that's evolving this quickly.

So I built an open-source toolkit with a few goals:

• Facilitate consistent AI-assisted coding

• Lean into AI's strengths while catching its weaknesses

• Keep mental overhead low

It's a Git repo you clone – no packages to install, no services to configure. Slash commands guide you through Specify → Plan → Execute, with automatic verification after each task.

If it's working well, you spend more time reviewing completed work than inspecting half-finished prompts.
