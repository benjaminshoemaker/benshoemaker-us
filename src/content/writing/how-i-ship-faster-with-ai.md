The way I write software has fundamentally changed. What used to take me a full day now often takes a few hours. And it's not because I'm typing faster—it's because I'm working *with* AI rather than just using it as a fancy autocomplete.

## The Shift in Mental Model

When I first started using AI coding tools, I treated them like Stack Overflow on steroids. Ask a question, get an answer, move on. That approach gets you maybe 10-20% productivity gains. The real unlock comes when you change how you think about the collaboration.

Instead of asking "how do I do X?", I now frame my work as a conversation: "Here's what I'm trying to build, here's my context, let's figure this out together."

## My Current Workflow

1. **Start with the spec, not the code.** I spend more time upfront writing clear descriptions of what I want to build. This investment pays off 10x when the AI understands my intent.

2. **Iterate in conversation.** Rather than context-switching between documentation, code, and the terminal, I stay in the conversation. The AI remembers what we discussed and builds on it.

3. **Trust but verify.** I've learned which patterns the AI handles well and where I need to double-check. This calibrated trust makes me faster without introducing bugs.

## What This Means for the Future

We're still in the early days. The tools will get better, but more importantly, we'll get better at using them. The developers who invest in learning this new paradigm will have a significant edge.
