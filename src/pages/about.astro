          I'm Ben Shoemaker. I build products with AI.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">Background</h2>
        <p class="text-text-body">
          For 12 years, I led data and analytics at Indeed  - creating company-wide success metrics used in board meetings, scaling SMB products 6x, managing organizations of 70+ people. I know how large enterprises work, how to build measurement systems that matter, and how to translate technical strategy into business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-body mt-4">
          Then I got laid off in the middle of 2025 and started building.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">What I've Built</h2>
        <p class="text-text-body">
          I launched VibeScaffold, a tool that turns rough product ideas into AI-ready specifications. It got 4,000+ users. I became technical co-founder of a stealth PropTech startup, building the full stack from scratch.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">What I Believe</h2>
        <p class="text-text-body">
          Here's what I've learned: AI tools have created a new kind of role. Not quite PM, not quite engineer. Someone who can hold product vision and demonstrate it by building. Someone who can prototype an idea in a day that used to take a team a quarter. Someone who doesn't just write specs  - they produce working software.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-body mt-4">
          I think companies will start hiring for this explicitly soon. For now, I'm doing a blend: building my own ventures, advising startups, consulting on AI workflows, and staying open to the right opportunity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary mt-8 mb-3">The Bigger Picture</h2>
        <p class="text-text-body">
          At a macro level, I'm apprehensive about where these tools are going - on a personal level, I have felt like these tools have unlocked me. I use to write and read code; now I manage the systems that produce it. If that sounds interesting, let's talk.
